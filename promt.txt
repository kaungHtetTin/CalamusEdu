I want to add a feature for /calamin/users/{language-specific} page.
For example, some user register for korean
so their data is now on learners table and ko-user-data table 
but not in ee-user-table.
So I want  the admin can add that user for ee-user-table from console.
So you need to check the user is already register in learners table but not in ee-user-table.

place the html form above user table below statistic section
